### About Me

- **Mathematician**: I am a Mathematician by education.
- **Robotics Software Engineer**: I became a robotics software engineer by "accident", but it keeps me interested.
- **C++ Programming**: This was actually the first language I learned by in 2000, and rediscovered in 2015.
- **Python**: Ironically, python got me back into C++.
- **Open Source**: I wish everything I created could be open source.
